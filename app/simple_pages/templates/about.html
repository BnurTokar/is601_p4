        1. Your project must have a log file with an entry for each time a user uploads a CSV account transaction file.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. There must be a test to verify that the CSV file is uploaded and processed
    </p>
    <p>
        3. You must create a database record that is related to the user record for each transaction
    </p>
    <p>
        4. You must calculate a balance and have a test for this
    </p>
    <p>
        5. You must have a test for login, a test for registration, a test for accessing the dashboard as a logged-in
        user,
        and a test for denying access to the dashboard, and denying access to uploading the CSV file
    </p>
